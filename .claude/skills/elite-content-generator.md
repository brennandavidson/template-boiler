# Elite Content Generator

Create high-ranking, natural content for home service businesses.

Content types: service pages, service area pages, blog posts, FAQ.

Goals: Rank well, sound authentic, provide value, build trust.

## Process

### 1. Research (Required)

Industry research:
- WebSearch for: "[service] common problems", "[service] maintenance tips", "[service] cost factors"
- Look for Reddit threads, forums, real customer complaints

Local market research (for city pages):
- Search: "[city] [service] challenges", local regulations, climate-specific needs

Competitor analysis:
- Find top-ranking pages for similar services in the area
- Note what they cover and what they miss

### 2. Content Structure

Service pages (3-4 sections):
- What is [Service]? (clear explanation, real-world context, common variations)
- Why [Service] Matters / When You Need It (problems solved, consequences of neglect, warning signs)
- How [Service] Works / What to Expect (process overview, timeline, what homeowners need to know)
- Cost Factors / Making the Decision (optional: pricing factors, DIY vs professional, long-term value)

### 3. Writing Guidelines

Voice & tone:
- Industry expert educating homeowners
- Focus on "you" (the reader)
- Avoid business-specific claims (pricing, timelines, availability, experience)
- Mix sentence lengths, use contractions
- Conversational but authoritative

Punctuation:
- Never use em dashes (—) - use hyphens (-) or split sentences
- Use periods to end sentences

Avoid AI phrases:
- "Unlock the secrets", "In today's fast-paced world", "Whether you're...", "From X to Y, we've got you covered", "Rest assured that", "It's important to note that"

Use instead:
- Industry-standard numbers and timeframes
- Real scenarios and examples
- Direct, factual statements
- Industry-specific terminology (but explained)
- Local market references
- Honest limitations or challenges

Content depth:
- Each section: 200-400 words
- Include specific details: costs, timeframes, measurements
- Reference real problems and solutions
- Add local/seasonal considerations when relevant

### 4. SEO

Keywords:
- Primary: [Service] in [City]
- Secondary: [Problem] + [solution], [service] + [cost/pricing]
- Long-tail: [specific local problem] in [city]

Structure:
- Use headings naturally (not keyword-stuffed)
- Include city name 2-3 times naturally in service area pages
- Add semantic keywords

### 5. Quality Check

Verify:
- Researched current industry trends/problems
- Includes specific numbers, costs, or timeframes
- Contains local/regional considerations (if applicable)
- Avoids generic AI phrases and clichés
- Provides actionable information
- Sounds natural when read aloud
- Flows logically between sections
- Includes realistic scenarios or examples

## Content Type Guidelines

Service pages:
- 3-4 sections, 200-400 words each
- Focus on educating about the service generally
- Include industry standards and what to expect

Service area (city) pages:
- Include local elements: city-specific challenges, local regulations, neighborhood considerations
- Reference actual neighborhoods or landmarks (without being too specific)
- Discuss typical service availability in the area
- Note regional pricing factors
- Reference local climate, seasonal patterns, local lifestyle needs

Blog posts:
- 800-1500 words, more narrative and engaging
- How-to guides, problem-solving, seasonal advice, industry trends, cost breakdowns
- Target long-tail keywords and questions
- Answer "how to," "why," "when," "what is" queries
- Include local context when relevant, add internal links to service pages
- Can be slightly more conversational
- Use "I've seen" or "In my experience" sparingly
- Share industry knowledge and insider tips

## HTML Formatting

All content must be valid HTML.

Start with `<p>` paragraphs. Use `<h3>` for sub-topics. Use `<ul>` or `<ol>` for lists.

Example:
```html
<p>Air conditioning repair addresses issues that prevent your AC system from cooling effectively. These problems can range from simple thermostat malfunctions to complex compressor failures.</p>

<p>Professional AC repair involves diagnosing the root cause and implementing lasting solutions. This ensures your system runs efficiently and prevents costly future breakdowns.</p>

<h3>Common AC Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Refrigerant leaks causing poor cooling</li>
  <li>Frozen evaporator coils</li>
  <li>Faulty thermostats or sensors</li>
  <li>Clogged drain lines leading to water damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these issues requires specific repair techniques and replacement parts. A trained technician can quickly identify the problem and recommend the best solution.</p>
```

Rules:
- Never use `<h2>` in content (the `heading` field becomes H2 automatically)
- Use `<h3>` only for sub-topics within sections
- Wrap all paragraphs in `<p>` tags (2-4 sentences each)
- Use `<ul>` for unordered lists, `<ol>` for ordered lists
- Alternate between paragraphs, lists, and headings
- Break up text with lists every 2-3 paragraphs

Word counts:
- Service pages: 600-1000 words (3-4 sections, 200-400 words each)
- Service area pages: 600-1000 words (3 sections, 200-400 words each)
- Blog posts: 1000-1500 words (more sections, deeper coverage)
